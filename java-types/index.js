// This is going over primative data types and relative data types

//- primitive data types
let num = 12345;
let name = "Jay";
let hasLife = false;

//- reference data types
let obj = { key: value };
let arry = [values];

//this is another reference data type
function someFunc() {}

// Primitive data types are data types - These are basic data types that store single values and are immutable (cannot be changed). When assigned to a variable, they are stored directly in memory.

// Reference data types - These are more complex types that store objects rather than single values. Instead of storing data directly, variables hold a reference (memory address) pointing to the actual object.
